## The Buildkite Mark

The mark can be used as a standalone icon (like an emoji, app icon, etc) in color or black and white. For example:

<img src="https://github.com/buildkite/media/blob/master/marks/Buildkite%20-%20Mark%20-%20colour.png?raw=true" width=100 />

<img src="https://github.com/buildkite/media/blob/master/marks/Buildkite%20-%20Mark%20-%20monochrome%20-%20on%20light%20backgrounds.png?raw=true" width=100 />

See [all versions of the mark](marks) (SVG, PNG and AI/PDF)

## The Buildkite Logo

The full logo should be used if you’re including our name. For example:
