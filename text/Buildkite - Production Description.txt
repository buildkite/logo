Buildkite is a CI and build automation tool that combines the power of your own build infrastructure with the convenience of a managed, centralized web UI. The open source agent is installable on any machine or network and provides a simple, repeatable process for running builds using the same tools you use for development and production. Buildkiteâ€™s centralized web service handles job distribution, agent monitoring, integration with GitHub and Slack, and provides everyone on your team with an elegant interface for monitoring builds, tailing logs and downloading artifacts.
